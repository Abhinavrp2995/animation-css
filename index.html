The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his empress consort Mumtaz Mahal (“Beloved Ornament of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. One of India’s most iconic mausoleums, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.</div>
