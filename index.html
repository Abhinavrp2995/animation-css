           <div class="doc">Taj Mahal, white marble mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–58) to immortalize his empress consort Mumtaz Mahal (“Beloved Ornament of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. One of India’s most iconic mausoleums, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.</div>

                <div class="doc">Majuli is a famous island in the River Bramhaputra, flowing in the state of Assam. It is the biggest district island in the country and is quite close to Jorhat. In 2016 it became the first island to be made a district in India. It had an area of 880 square kilometres (340 sq mi) at the beginning of the 20th century, but having lost significantly to erosion it covers 880 square kilometres (340 sq mi) as at 2014. Majuli has shrunk as the river surrounding it has grown. The island is formed by the Brahmaputra River in the south and the Kherkutia Xuti, an anabranch of the Brahmaputra, joined by the Subansiri River in the north. Mājuli island is accessible by ferries from the city of Jorhat.</div>

The first settlements outside the fort walls, to accommodate the growing population of Jaisalmer, are said to have come up in the 17th century.</div>
